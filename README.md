##Motivation for the Build

I always enjoyed seeing LCD display's as a Kid as it 
feels like their is someone in the back communicating with 
me, so I wanted to determine how to interface an FPGA
with an LCD screen to output valid inputs, which I did
with the help of an Arduino to control the LCD and translate
the inputs from the FPGA to ASCII text.
