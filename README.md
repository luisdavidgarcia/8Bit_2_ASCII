## To Get Started

Click and Read the User Manual it has the extension .pdf

## Motivation for the Build

I always enjoyed seeing LCD display's as a Kid as it 
reminds me of playing on my old GameBoy, so I wanted to determine how to interface an FPGA
with an LCD screen to output valid inputs.

I found a method of doing so with the help of an Arduino to control the LCD and translate
the inputs from the FPGA to ASCII text.
